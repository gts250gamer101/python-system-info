# python-system-info
A simple system information application, created entirely with Python.

I made this app via Python to help me find the specs of some older computers. It is very nice to be able to load this onto a flash drive with an install of Debian, boot up the computer, and see the specs.

This is my first-ever GitHub project, and, quite honestly, I don't have the hang of things.
Thank you for trying out my app!
